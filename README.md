# Softsurf: A Data Driven Approach to Sweet Success

This analysis uses SQLite in pandas to describe the key differences in weather to launch a successful surf and icecream shop to understand if temperatures and rainy seasons would create a failure or launch a softsurf success. 

## Using Data to avoid a Weather Wipeout
- Average temperature for June is 75, while average for December is 71
- Lowest temperatures for June was 64 with December at 56

**June Stats:**

- These temperatures vary only slightly so we should check the rainfall to compare. Using a similiar query as temperature, we can find the stats for rainfall and see that December has the highest amount:

## SQL Shakas Brah
While temperatures might be slightly cooler in December and rainfall a fair amount higher, every good surfer knows the winter storms create better swell and the likelihood of surf tourism during the winter months is high. Even though temperatures might deter folks from icecream, it can be concluded that the business is sustainabile year round banking off of tourists coming to enjoy sunny waves with a scoop versus those chasing a real swell. We should get the wind weather data to run another query on when the winds begin to pick up to increase the swell as well as when the winds begin to shift to the dreaded onshore breeze.
